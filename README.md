## Running the Application

A `Makefile` is included to streamline the process of managing the microservice lifecycle and database operations. Below are the steps to build, run, and stop the application:

### Starting the Services

To build and start the microservices in detached mode, run:

```bash
make up
```

### Run Database Migrations

Once the services are up and running, you'll need to execute the database migrations for both the wallet and user microservices. Use the following commands:

```bash
make migrate
```

### Stop and Remove Containers

To stop the services and remove all containers, use the following command:

```bash
make down
```
